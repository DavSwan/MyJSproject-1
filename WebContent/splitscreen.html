						<h2>Banana Egg Pancakes</h2>
						<h4 class="recipeheadings">Ingredients</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>1 ripe Banana</li>
							<li>2 large Eggs</li>
							<li>oil for cooking</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Instructions</h4>
						<ol>
							<li>Mash the banana. Peel the banana and break it up into
								several big chunks in a medium bowl. Use a dinner fork to
								thoroughly mash the banana.</li>
							<li>Stir in the eggs. Pour the eggs over the banana and stir
								until completely combined. The batter will be very loose and
								liquidy, more like whisked eggs than regular pancake batter.</li>
							<li>Heat a pan over medium heat. Heat a cast iron pan,
								nonstick frying pan, or griddle over medium heat. Melt a little
								butter or warm a little vegetable oil in the pan if desired.</li>
							<li>Drop the batter on hot griddle. Drop about 2 tablespoons
								of batter into the pan. It should sizzle immediately — if not,
								turn up the heat slightly. Repeat with dropping more batter into
								the pan, leaving at least an inch or two between pancakes.</li>
							<li>Cook for about 1 minute. Cook the pancakes until the
								bottoms look browned and golden when you lift a corner, about 1
								minute. The edges should also be starting to look set, but the
								center will still be loose.</li>
							<li>Flip the pancakes. I've found it best to do this very
								gently and fairly slowly — the opposite of regular pancakes.
								Gently work a thin, flat spatula about halfway under the
								pancake, then lift until the unsupported half of the pancake is
								just barely lifted off the skillet. Flip the pancake.</li>
							<li>Cook for another minute or so. Cook until the other side
								is also golden-brown, about 1 minute more. You can flip the
								pancakes a few times if you need to in order to get them evenly
								browned.</li>
							<li>Continue cooking the pancakes. Transfer the cooked
								pancakes to a serving plate and cook the rest of the batter.
								Keep the finished pancakes warm in the oven if cooking more than
								a single batch.</li>
							<li>Serve warm. These pancakes are best when eaten fresh off
								the griddle and still warm. Serve with maple syrup, honey, jam,
								or any extra toppings you'd like.</li>
